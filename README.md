# An-automated-system-to-limit-covid-19-using-facemask-detection-in-smart-city-network

This project can be used to control the spread of COVID-19 by indentifying people who are not wearing masks in public places. This project uses mobilenetv2 to train the model and opencv to capture imagers from a live stream.

The dataset for this project is downloaded from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection
